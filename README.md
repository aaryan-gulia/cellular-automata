# cellular-automata
A Cellular Automata Engine using Rust and Bevy

# Latest Progress
- Elementary Cellular Automata simulation has been implemented in Bevy
- Basic Conway's game of life simulation complete
- Bevy UI implemented for user control 

# Next Steps
- Implementing run-time parameter adjustments with BevyUI
- Enabling Camera movement in 3D
- Developing 2D and 3D Cellular Automata Simulations
- Implementing parallel processing for GPU optimization
